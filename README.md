# JohnClinicBooking_system
A Clinic Booking Management System Database, that contains only Create database, create tables as the deliverables 



Hereâ€™s a README.md that explains your SQL schema, focusing on the syntax and structure rather than rewriting the code itself:


---

John Clinic Booking System â€“ Database Schema

This project defines the database schema for a clinic appointment and treatment booking system using SQL. The schema demonstrates different relationship types (1:1, 1:N, M:N) and proper database design principles.


---

ðŸ“Œ Database Creation

CREATE DATABASE JohnClinicBooking_System;
USE JohnClinicBooking_System;

CREATE DATABASE â†’ Creates a new database named JohnClinicBooking_System.

USE â†’ Selects the database so that all subsequent SQL statements run inside it.



---

ðŸ“Œ Table Definitions

1. Patients Table

CREATE TABLE Patients (
    patient_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(70) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(70) NOT NULL,
    date_of_birth DATE,
    phone VARCHAR(70),
    email VARCHAR(70) UNIQUE
);

patient_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY â†’ Creates a unique identifier for each patient, automatically increasing with each entry.

VARCHAR(70) â†’ Defines text columns with a maximum length of 70 characters.

NOT NULL â†’ Ensures the field cannot be left empty.

UNIQUE â†’ Prevents duplicate values (e.g., no two patients with the same email).

DATE â†’ Used for date_of_birth.



---

2. Doctors Table

CREATE TABLE Doctors (
    doctor_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
    specialty VARCHAR(200)
);

doctor_id â†’ Works the same way as patient_id.

specialty â†’ Defines the doctorâ€™s field (e.g., cardiology, pediatrics).



---

3. Appointments Table

CREATE TABLE Appointments (
    appointment_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_id INT NOT NULL,
    doctor_id INT NOT NULL,
    appointment_date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    reason TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES Patients(patient_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES Doctors(doctor_id)
);

appointment_id â†’ Unique ID for each appointment.

DATETIME â†’ Stores both date and time of appointment.

TEXT â†’ Used for longer, variable-length strings (reason for visit).

FOREIGN KEY â†’ Links the table to Patients and Doctors, enforcing referential integrity.

One Patient â†’ Many Appointments (1:N).

One Doctor â†’ Many Appointments (1:N).




---

4. Treatments Table

CREATE TABLE Treatments (
    treatment_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    treatment_name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);

Defines available treatments (e.g., physical therapy, surgery).

Stored independently so multiple doctors can offer the same treatment.



---

5. Doctor_Treatments (Many-to-Many Relationship)

CREATE TABLE Doctor_Treatments (
    doctor_id INT NOT NULL,
    treatment_id INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (doctor_id, treatment_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES Doctors(doctor_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (treatment_id) REFERENCES Treatments(treatment_id)
);

Composite Primary Key (doctor_id, treatment_id) â†’ Prevents duplicate doctor-treatment pairs.

Models a many-to-many (M:N) relationship:

One doctor can offer multiple treatments.

One treatment can be offered by multiple doctors.




---

6. Doctor_Offices (One-to-One Relationship)

CREATE TABLE Doctor_Offices (
    doctor_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    office_location VARCHAR(250) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES Doctors(doctor_id)
);

Primary Key = doctor_id â†’ Ensures one office is linked to exactly one doctor.

Represents a one-to-one (1:1) relationship:

Each doctor has only one office.

Each office belongs to only one doctor.




---

ðŸ“Œ Relationship Summary

Patients â†’ Appointments: One-to-Many

Doctors â†’ Appointments: One-to-Many

Doctors â†” Treatments: Many-to-Many (via Doctor_Treatments)

Doctors â†’ Offices: One-to-One



---

ðŸ“Œ Key SQL Concepts in Use

PRIMARY KEY â†’ Unique identifier for each record.

AUTO_INCREMENT â†’ Automatically generates sequential IDs.

FOREIGN KEY â†’ Ensures data integrity between related tables.

NOT NULL â†’ Prevents missing critical values.

UNIQUE â†’ Avoids duplicate data in certain fields (like email).

VARCHAR vs TEXT vs DATE/DATETIME â†’ Different data types for strings, large text, and date/time.



---

âœ… This schema is structured to handle patient management, doctor details, scheduling, and treatment offerings in a normalized, relational way.


---

Do you want me to also add an ER diagram illustration (visual relationships) in the README to make it easier to understand, or keep it strictly text-based?
